## Features

- **DNS Packet Sniffing**: The script can sniff DNS packets on the network interface specified by the user.
- **Verbose Output**: It provides detailed output if the user enables the verbose mode
- **Target IP Analysis**: Users can specify a target IP address to analyze DNS responses 
- **DNS Type Analysis**: Users can analyze different types of DNS requests.
- **DNS over HTTPS (DoH)**: Users can enable DNS resolution using DNS over HTTPS.
- **Target Domain Monitoring**: Users can specify a list of target domains to monitor.
- **Port Filtering**: It supports filtering by source or destination port.
- **IP Filtering**: Users can filter packets by source or destination IP address.
- **DNS Type Filtering**: allows users to filter packets by DNS type.
- **PCAP File Saving**: Users can save captured packets to a PCAP file.
- **DNS Firewall Mode**: The DNS firewall mode for detecting DNS spoofing attempts.
- **Threshold Setting**: Users can set the threshold for the number of DNS queries .
- **Window Size Configuration**: Allows users to configure the window size (in seconds) for monitoring.
- **Version Information**: Users can check the version of the script.

```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```
$ python3 dnswatch.py [-h] [-i INTERFACE] [-v] [-t TARGET_IP] [-d] [--doh] [-D TARGET_DOMAINS [TARGET_DOMAINS ...]] [-p FILTER_PORT] [-s FILTER_SRC_IP] [-r FILTER_DST_IP] [--dns-type DNS_TYPE] [--pcap-file PCAP_FILE] [--firewall] [--threshold THRESHOLD] [--window-size WINDOW_SIZE] [--version]```
```

1. `-i, --interface`: Used to specify the network interface to listen on. For example: `-i eth0`
2. `-v, --verbose`: Use this flag to get detailed output.
3. `-t, --target-ip`: Used to specify a specific IP address to monitor. For example: `-t 8.8.8.8`
4. `-d, --analyze-dns-type`: Use this flag to analyze DNS types.
5. `--doh`: Use DNS over HTTPS (DoH) for DNS resolution.
6. `-D, --target-domains`: Used to specify the target domains to monitor. Accepts a space-separated list of multiple domain names. For example: `-D example.com example.org`
7. `-p, --filter-port`: Use this flag followed by a port number to filter by a specific port. For example: `-p 53`
8. `-s, --filter-src-ip`: Use this flag to filter by a specific source IP address. For example: `-s 192.168.1.1`
9. `-r, --filter-dst-ip`: Use this flag to filter by a specific destination IP address. For example: `-r 8.8.4.4`
10. `--dns-type`: Use this flag followed by a DNS type to filter by a specific DNS type. For example: `--dns-type 1` (for type A)
11. `--pcap-file`: Use this flag to save captured packets to a PCAP file. For example: `--pcap-file captured_packets.pcap`
12. `--firewall`: Enable DNS firewall mode.
13. `--threshold`: Use this flag to set the threshold for the number of DNS queries. For example: `--threshold 50`
14. `--window-size`: Use this flag to set the window size (in seconds). For example: `--window-size 60`
15. `--version`: Use this flag to display the program's version number.


Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the sniffing process.
